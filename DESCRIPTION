Description: countland includes a set of functions for 
    applying a restricted linear algebra to the analysis 
    of count-based data. This tool is specifically designed 
    to analyze count matrices from single cell RNA 
    sequencing assays. The tool implement several 
    count-based approaches for standard steps in scRNA-seq
    analysis, including scoring genes and cells, comparing
    cells and clustering, calculating differential 
    gene expression, and several methods for rank reduction.
    There are many opportunities for further
    optimization that may prove useful in the anlaysis of
    other data. We provide the source code freely
    available at https://github.com/shchurch/countland
    and encourage users and developers to fork the code for 
    their own purposes.
